		Imports a QOA audio file for playback.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		QOA is a lossy audio format, with worse audio quality when compared to [ResourceImporterOggVorbis] and [ResourceImporterMP3], but significantly better than [ResourceImporterWAV] when compressed as IMA-ADPCM.
		It's recommended to use QOA when you need to play a lot of simultaneous sounds, but also save memory.

		<member name="loop_offset" type="float" setter="" getter="" default="0">
			Determines where audio will start to loop after playback reaches the end of the audio. This can be used to only loop a part of the audio file, which is useful for some ambient sounds or music. The value is determined in seconds relative to the beginning of the audio. A value of [code]0.0[/code] will loop the entire audio file.
			Only has an effect if [member loop] is [code]true[/code].
